## Technical Highlights

### Custom Loading Animation
The app features a custom mountain loading screen animation showing mountains rising from the ground, snow caps forming, trees appearing, and a sun risingâ€”all drawn using custom SwiftUI shapes and paths. This animation involves sequenced timing and positioning of elements, demonstrating advanced SwiftUI animation capabilities.

### Location-Based Park Discovery
The app implements location-aware functionality that determines the five closest national parks to the user's current location, providing an intuitive starting point for planning adventures to nearby parks. This involved Apple's location services framework, calculating distances between the user and all national parks, and presenting them with appropriate distance formatting.
